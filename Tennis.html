                Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century northern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">France</a> France, where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_X_of_France">Louis X of France</a>  was a keen player of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeu_de_paume">jeu de paume</a></i>  ("game of the palm"), which evolved into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_tennis">real tennis</a> , and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris "around the end of the 13th century". <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-Newman-3">[3]</a></sup>  In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-Newman-3">[3]</a></sup>  In June 1316 at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincennes">Vincennes</a> , Val-de-Marne, and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>  or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurisy">pleurisy</a> , although there was also suspicion of poisoning. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-Gillmeister-4">[4]</a></sup>  Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis player known by name. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-Gillmeister-4">[4]</a></sup>  Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V_of_France">Charles V of France</a> , who had a court set up at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre_Palace">Louvre Palace.</a> <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

                It was not until the 16th century that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_racket">rackets</a>  came into use and the game began to be called "tennis", from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a>  term tenez, which can be translated as "hold!", "receive!" or "take!", an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interjection">interjection</a>  used as a call from the server to his opponent. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>  It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors, where the ball could be hit off the wall. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry VIII of England</a>  was a big fan of this game, which is now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_tennis">real tennis.</a> <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> 

                An epitaph in St Michael's Church, Coventry, written circa 1705, read, in part:[8]
                <ul>
                    <li>Here lyes an old toss'd Tennis Ball</li>
                    <li>Was racketted, from spring to fall</li>
                    <li>With so much heat and so much hast</li>
                    <li>Time's arm for shame grew tyred at last</li>
                </ul>
