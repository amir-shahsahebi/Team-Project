            <h4>Predecessors</h4>
            <p>
                Historians believe that the game's ancient origin lay in 12th century northern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">France</a> France, where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_X_of_France">Louis X of France</a>  was a keen player of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeu_de_paume">jeu de paume</a></i>  ("game of the palm"), which evolved into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_tennis">real tennis</a> , and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris "around the end of the 13th century". <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-Newman-3">[3]</a></sup>  In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-Newman-3">[3]</a></sup>  In June 1316 at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincennes">Vincennes</a> , Val-de-Marne, and following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>  or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurisy">pleurisy</a> , although there was also suspicion of poisoning. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-Gillmeister-4">[4]</a></sup>  Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis X is history's first tennis player known by name. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-Gillmeister-4">[4]</a></sup>  Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V_of_France">Charles V of France</a> , who had a court set up at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre_Palace">Louvre Palace.</a> <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

                It was not until the 16th century that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_racket">rackets</a>  came into use and the game began to be called "tennis", from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a>  term tenez, which can be translated as "hold!", "receive!" or "take!", an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interjection">interjection</a>  used as a call from the server to his opponent. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>  It was popular in England and France, although the game was only played indoors, where the ball could be hit off the wall. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England">Henry VIII of England</a>  was a big fan of this game, which is now known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_tennis">real tennis.</a> <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

            <h3>Court</h3>
            <i>Main article:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court"> Tennis court</a></i>
            
            
                <p>
                    Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(length)">feet</a>  (23.77 m) long, and 27 feet (8.2 m) wide for singles matches and 36 ft (11 m) for doubles matches. <sup><a href="">[48]</a></sup> Additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a cord or metal cable of diameter no greater than 0.8 cm (1⁄3 in). <sup><a href="">[49]</a></sup> The net is 3 feet 6 inches (1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet (0.91 m) high in the centre. <sup><a href="">[48]</a></sup> The net posts are 3 feet (0.91 m) outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, 3 feet (0.91 m) outside the singles court on each side.
<br>
                    The modern tennis court owes its design to Major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Clopton_Wingfield">Walter Clopton Wingfield</a> . In 1873, Wingfield patented a court much the same as the current one for his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick%C3%A9">stické tennis</a>  (sphairistike). This template was modified in 1875 to the court design that exists today, with markings similar to Wingfield's version, but with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hourglass"> hourglass</a> shape of his court changed to a rectangle. <sup><a href="">[50]</a></sup>

                    Tennis is unusual in that it is played on a variety of surfaces. <sup><a href="">[51]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court"> Grass</a>, clay, and hard courts of concrete or asphalt topped with acrylic are the most common. Occasionally carpet is used for indoor play, with hardwood flooring having been historically used. Artificial turf courts can also be found.

                <h3>Lines</h3>
                <p>
                    The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark in the centre of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the centre mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines; they are the boundaries for doubles matches. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines, and are the boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the centre of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve. <sup><a href="">[52]</a></sup>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The line dividing the service line in two is called the centre line or centre service line. The boxes this centre line creates are called the service boxes; depending on a player's position, they have to hit the ball into one of these when serving. <sup><a href="">[53]</a></sup> A ball is out only if none of it has hit the area inside the lines, or the line, upon its first bounce. All lines are required to be between 1 and 2 inches (25 and 51 mm) in width, with the exception of the baseline which can be up to 4 inches (100 mm) wide, although in practice it is often the same width as the others. <sup><a href="">[52]</a></sup>
