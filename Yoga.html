                    The Sanskrit noun yoga is derived from the Sanskrit root yuj  "to attach, join, harness, yoke". The word yoga is cognate with English "yoke". According to Burley, the first use of the root of the word "yoga" is in hymn 5.81.1 of the Rig Veda, a dedication to the rising Sun-god in the morning (Savitri), where it has been interpreted as "yoke" or "yogically control"

                There is no consensus on its chronology or origins, other than that yoga developed in ancient India. There are broadly two kinds of theories on the origins of yoga. The linear model argues that yoga has Aryan origins, as reflected in the Vedic textual corpus, and influenced Buddhism; this model is mainly supported by Hindu scholars. The synthesis model argues that yoga is a synthesis of indigenous, non-Aryan practices with Aryan elements; this model is favoured in western scholarship.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pre-philosophical speculations of yoga began to emerge in the early Upanishads of the first half of the first millennium BCE. Expositions appear in Jain, Buddhist and proto-orthodox texts of c. 500 – c. 200 BCE. Between 200 BCE and 500 CE, "technical traditions of Indian philosophy (Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain) were taking form, collecting their teachings in sutra-collections, and a coherent philosophical system of "Patanjaliyogasastra" began to emerge. The Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga. Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy.

                A process or discipline leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikyam">oneness (Aikyam)</a>with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman">Divine (Brahman)</a> or with one's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism)">Self (Atman)</a>. The formulation of this goal varies with the philosophical or theological system with which it is conjugated. In the classical Astanga yoga system, the ultimate goal of yoga practice is to achieve the state of Samadhi and abide in that state as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purusha">pure awareness</a>.

                According to Jacobsen, Yoga has five principal traditional meanings:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A disciplined method for attaining a goal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Techniques of controlling the body and the mind.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A name of a school or system of philosophy (darśana).
                </li>
                <li>
                    With prefixes such as "hatha-, mantra-, and laya-, traditions specialising in particular techniques of yoga.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The goal of Yoga practice.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                According to David Gordon White, from the 5th century CE onward, the core principles of "yoga" were more or less in place, and variations of these principles developed in various forms over time:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    A meditative means of discovering dysfunctional perception and cognition, as well as overcoming it to release any suffering, find inner peace, and salvation. Illustration of this principle is found in Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Yogasutras, in a number of Buddhist Mahāyāna works, as well as Jain texts.   
                </li>
                <li>
                    The raising and expansion of consciousness from oneself to being coextensive with everyone and everything. These are discussed in sources such as in Hinduism Vedic literature and its Epic Mahābhārata, Jainism Praśamaratiprakarana, and Buddhist Nikaya texts.
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    A path to omniscience and enlightened consciousness enabling one to comprehend the impermanent (illusive, delusive) and permanent (true, transcendent) reality. Examples of this are found in Hinduism Nyaya and Vaisesika school texts as well as Buddhism Mādhyamaka texts, but in different ways.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A technique for entering into other bodies, generating multiple bodies, and the attainment of other supernatural accomplishments. These are, states White, described in Tantric literature of Hinduism and Buddhism, as well as the Buddhist Sāmaññaphalasutta.[48] James Mallinson, however, disagrees and suggests that such fringe practices are far removed from the mainstream Yoga's goal as meditation-driven means to liberation in Indian religions.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                White clarifies that the last principle relates to legendary goals of "yogi practice", different from practical goals of "yoga practice," as they are viewed in South Asian thought and practice since the beginning of the Common Era, in the various Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain philosophical schools.
